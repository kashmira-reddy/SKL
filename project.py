    #--make sure that the APIs work or have backup ready to use like reddit
# What data will you collect from each API/website and store in a database?  Be specific.
# API1: We will collect different breeds of dogs and pictures of them. We will look up many breeds of dogs. 
# API2: We will find memes related to the specific breed of dog we have found using API1. We will look it up with many breeds of dogs. 
# Website: We will look for the tweets that mention that specific breed we found in API1. We will look it up with many breeds of dogs. 
# What data will you be calculating from the data in the database?
# We will be calculating the number of different breeds from the dog API.
# We will be calculating how many of these are used in memes from the meme API.
# We will also calculate how prevalent dogs, memes, and dog memes are on Twitter.
